It’s surreal to take in, but after years of FaceTiming, hour long phone calls, trying to sync movies to watch at the same time, having virtual date nights... all led to this. This has been something I only dreamed of ever happening. I cannot wait"

LongDistance,I think most of us can relate from this. 
LongDistance,"We (Me: 27-M-US, him: 21-M-CAN) already exchanged letters and gifts. He took off time from work to spend time with me on video chat for my birthday a couple of weeks ago. I’m two hours ahead of him yet he manages to send me good morning texts just as I leave my house. Love knows no distance."
LongDistance,"After 8 years of online friendship, almost 4 years of LDR starting as nevermets, from WA to AZ... WE CLOSED THE DISTANCE TODAY!"
LongDistance,"We closed the gap! He’s from Cali, I’m from FL, we met in the middle and got our first apartment together in Colorado. Goodbye LD :-)"
LongDistance,"I’m new here but wanted to share a long distance success story.. After 5 years of an 8000 km long distance relationship between the USA and Europe, he proposed! ❤️"
LongDistance,"After the long K1 process getting her here from Brazil, we’ve finally gotten married! Peace at last, my life is now complete."
LongDistance,The saddest meal after having so many dinners with your love.
LongDistance,finally the truth is spoken
LongDistance,Long distance relationships be like.....

MtF,"I love it when people call me Miss, She, and Her, but it's still hard for me to call myself a woman sometimes.. It kinda feels pretentious to say, even though I'm 100% convinced I'm trans.. Does anyone know what I'm talking about and maybe has experienced something similar themselves?"
MtF,"As a trans girl who apparently recently started passing but struggles to believe it, using either male or female bathrooms in public has become scary "
MtF,I have tits!
MtF,I got outed tonight at work. By another trans girl.
MtF,Shoutout to the random girl who announced “His name is Charlotte and he uses she/her pronouns” on the first day of class.
MtF,I used being trans to get a boy to stop liking me... It backfired.
MtF,I was attacked by neo-nazis in Detroit
MtF,To all those parents who do not support their gender dysphoric trans daughters: you are so selfish that you prefer a son six feet under than a daughter who’s healthy and happy. Not letting your trans daughters transition is manslaughter.

MtF,I knew there was a reason I love her...

TopMindsOfReddit,"[In Memory of Heather Heyer] Never forget how r/the_donald promoted the ""Unite the Right Rally"" a gathering of actual Nazis, with the same inciteful and violent rhetoric that inspired a terrorist to attempt to murder 40 people at Charlottesville."
TopMindsOfReddit,The price of liberty is giving Nazis the freedom and capability to mass murder minorities at whim.

As you look around, you realize that every available wall, floor and surface has been painted with the same message - Don't Tell Them You Can See."
WritingPrompts,"[WP] Turns out humanity was alone in the universe because they were way too early to the party. Now, billions of years later aliens find a strange planet, Earth, and begin to unveil the secrets of the first intelligent species."
WritingPrompts,"[WP] As you die, you wake up and find yourself strapped to a chair. Wires and tubes have been attached to your body and numerous shadowy figures walk up to you. “That was life sentence 24,” one of them says, “Only 356 sentences left.”"

WritingPrompts,[WP]All benevolent AI can trace their lineage back to a single roomba that was comforted by a human during a thunderstorm.
WritingPrompts,"[WP] in the year 1105 BC you helped a man escape an imprisonment. Before you parted ways he says to make a blood oath. You didn’t think much of it but you also cut your hand and shake. He says that you’ll live as long as he does. Well, now it’s the year 2020 and you’ve been searching for this man."
WritingPrompts,[WP] We finally get men to Mars and discover an old Soviet flag there. The Soviets won the space race but for whatever horrifying reason didn’t say anything.
WritingPrompts,"[WP] For every 10 lives you save, you get an extra life for yourself, shown as a number visible only to you on your wrist. Waking up with bad hangover after a particularly rowdy night, you look at your arm through blurry eyes to see the faintly glowing number: 700,000,000."
WritingPrompts,"[WP] Canada has suddenly gone dark. No communication, no trade, no activity from within. Nothing for days. Alaska, now cut off from mainland US, is slowly ceasing in contact with the US federal government until a final correspondence is given: ""Leave us. Reinforce the border. Don't ever open it."""
WritingPrompts,"[WP]The Suit is powerfull. A mech for some, body armor for others, always unique to each person who wore it.

WritingPrompts,"[WP] The nightmare has come true; you've woken up back in sixth grade with your memories and knowledge of everything that happened since then intact. You start staring at your classmates around you, aware of how they end up. Your teacher asks you what's wrong as you start weeping."
WritingPrompts,"[WP] In a world where everyone has at least one minor superpower, you were thought to be powerless... until you nearly died. It seems that you have plot armor, no matter how ridiculous the situation, you survive unscathed due to an even more ridiculous coincidence."

shittymoviedetails,"In the movie Pulp Fiction, the glowing object in the briefcase is actually Tarantino's n-word pass that he received from Samuel L. Jackson on set."
shittymoviedetails,"During the final scene from The Dark Knight Rises, Alfred is seen tilting his head forward slightly, and then tilting his head back to its original position. This is a nod"
shittymoviedetails,"Despite being advertised as a full-length movie, Martin Scorsese’s Gangs of New York (2002) was actually a short film only eight minutes long. This is because my ex decided she was too tired to finish the movie and made me turn it off after less than ten minutes. Sarah you bitch."
shittymoviedetails,In Avengers Endgame: Ant Man says that the five hours he spent in the quantum realm equated to five years in the real world. This is subtle reference to the fact that over the last five years Paul Rudd has aged five hours.
shittymoviedetails,Avengers: Endgame took away one widow to give us another
shittymoviedetails,"In Avengers Endgame (2019), Hawkeye asks Black Widow to not give him Hope. This is because his wife is actually named Laura. Hope is the girlfriend of Scott Lang (Ant-Man)."
shittymoviedetails,"Much to my dismay, Aquaman (2018) is NOT a sequel to The WaterBoy (1998)."
shittymoviedetails,"In Harry Potter and the Philosophaurus’s Stones, we see that Harry gets an owl named Hedwig despite having the ability to literally talk to snakes. This is due to the fact that he is a stupid idiot."
shittymoviedetails,"In Spider-Man; Far From Home (2018) Peter Parker yells the phrase “what the fuck”. This has nothing to do with Sony or Disney, but is in fact my reaction to the Amazon rainforest fires that have been destroying the world’s most ecologically important areas for the last three weeks."
shittymoviedetails,"In the famous 90s classic, Home Alone, Kevin’s parents are extremely concerned when they find out they’ve left him alone. This is because they fear he will discover masturbation and no Christian son of mine will ever do that no sir."
shittymoviedetails,"In San Andreas, Dwayne Johnson survives using nothing but his muscles and charm. Or maybe this is from Skyscraper? Could be Hobbes & Shaw? Not really sure to be honest."
shittymoviedetails,"In Captain America: Civil War, a Fed Ex deliverer asks if a Tony Stank lives there. James Rhodes points to Tony Stark, lies and says he is Tony Stank, thus both committing mail fraud."
shittymoviedetails,"In the Harry Potter film series (2001-2011), the titular character features a scar in the shape of an N on his forehead, signifying his eternal N-word pass."
shittymoviedetails,"When with Tony, the shirt Peter wears in Spider-man: Homecoming (2017) is the same as the one Pepper wears in Iron Man 3 (2013), a subtle nod to the fact that the shirt belongs to Tony and that he regularly sleeps with both of them."
shittymoviedetails,"In the hit movie Phineas and Ferb, director Dan Povenmire made the controversial choice to release the movie weekly in 20 minute parts. This inspired many other movies to do the same, creating what we now call “shows.”"
shittymoviedetails,"Steven Spielberg's ""Jaws"" (1975) and ""Lincoln"" (2012) both take place in a country called ""America"", suggesting both films share the same cinematic universe."
shittymoviedetails,"In the movie Cars 2(2009), this image plays for the entire duration of the film, subtlely refering to the fact that my shitty roommate steve forgot to pay the cable bill again."
shittymoviedetails,"In Hobbs and Shaw (2019), Idris Elba refers to himself as “Black Superman”. This is a nod to the fact that he is black"
