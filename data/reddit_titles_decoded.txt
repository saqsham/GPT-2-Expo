To all those parents who do not support their gender dysphoric trans daughters: you are so selfish that you prefer a son six feet under than a daughter who’s healthy and happy. Not letting your trans daughters transition is manslaughter.

Why is it considered normal for the average person to work for 8-12hours daily while having no to little break or vacation to sit with the family? I think that might be the reason why people become more stressed and no one is talking about that.
